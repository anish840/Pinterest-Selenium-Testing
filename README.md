# Pinterest-Selenium-Testingg
This project automates various tasks on Pinterest using Selenium WebDriver. It simulates user actions like login, search, saving pins, and navigating boards, providing a streamlined experience for automating repetitive Pinterest tasks.


Introduction
This project focuses on automating the following Pinterest tasks:

Login to Pinterest: Automates logging into Pinterest using user credentials.
Pin Creation: Automates the process of uploading an image and creating a new pin with a title.
The project is written using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and pytest, allowing for scalable and maintainable test automation.

Features

Automated Login: Logs into Pinterest using stored credentials.
Pin Creation: Uploads an image and assigns a title to create a new pin.
Test Automation: Tests are structured using pytest for easy execution.
Error Handling: Handles exceptions like missing elements and timeouts.
Technologies Used
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation.
pytest: Python testing framework.
Python 3.x: The language used for writing the tests.
ChromeDriver: WebDriver used to automate Google Chrome.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.
Google Chrome installed.
ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome version) installed and added to your PATH.
pip for installing Python dependencies.
Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pinterest-selenium-testing.git
cd pinterest-selenium-testing
Install dependencies: Install the required Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set environment variables for Pinterest credentials (recommended for security):

bash
Copy code
export PINTEREST_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export PINTEREST_PASSWORD="your_password"
Download ChromeDriver:

Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver for your system.
Add ChromeDriver to your system PATH.
Running the Tests
Using pytest
Login test: To run the Pinterest login automation test, execute:

bash
Copy code
pytest -k "test_login"
Pin creation test: To run the test that creates a new pin, use:

bash
Copy code
pytest -k "test_create_pin"
Example Usage
bash
Copy code
pytest -v
This command will run all tests and provide verbose output.

Future Improvements
Adding more comprehensive tests for Pinterest functionality (e.g., creating boards, saving pins).
Implementing a headless browser mode for faster, non-UI-based testing.
Enhanced logging and reporting of test results.
